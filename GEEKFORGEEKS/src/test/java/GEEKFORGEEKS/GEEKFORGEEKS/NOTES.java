// whenever we consider complexity , the size of input will always be >=0
	//input n >=0
	//time taken by a func should also be >=0
	// n>=0, fun1() or fun2() >=0
	//to prove that one func runs beter than the other, we compare order of growth of 2 functions
	//and we always talk about large values of n
	//we are going to define some mathematical notation and they are applicable for n tends to infinity.
	//the constants can be ignored when n -> infinity
	//compare say fun1 and fun2
	// 2n +5 > 10, n=2.5, so say for n=3, your program works faster than yr friends code 
	// n+1 > 1000, n > 999, so for n=999, your program will do better than yr friends program, which satisfies the 
	// the reason that always consider large values of n
	
	
	// order of growth :
